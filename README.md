## Introduction

This project 

## Data

The datasets I used are:

_Terrestrial Air Temperature and Precipitation_
The [University of Delaware's] (https://www.psl.noaa.gov/data/gridded/data.UDel_AirT_Precip.html) Terrestrial Air Temperature and Precipitation dataset is monthly temperature and precipitation (only the temperature is used in this project) ranging from January 1900 to December 2014. It has a resolution of 0.5 degree latitude x 0.5 degree longitude global grid (720x360).

_GPCP Precipitation_
The Global Precipitation Climatology Project, or [GCPC] (https://psl.noaa.gov/data/gridded/data.gpcp.html), is a monthly global precipitation dataset ranging from January 1979 to September 2023. It has a resolution of 2.5 degree latitude x 2.5 degree longitude global grid (144x72).
